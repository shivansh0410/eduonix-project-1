                    Origins of the Rafale Fighter Jet
Towards the closing decades of the Cold War in the 1970s, the French military was looking to replace their current fleets of aircraft. To mitigate development coasts ad earn a hefty profit, France signed deals with the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy to produce a multirole fighter jet, the Eurofighter Typhoon. 

However, multiple disagreements over intellectual property rights, workshare and difference in requirements led France to back out of the deal and pursue its own aircraft development programme.

The French government released a tender where they invited major defence contractors to demonstrate their technology. The tender was awarded to Dassault in July 1986 as a part of an eight-year-flight-test programme, laying the groundwork of the Rafale fighter jet project. 

The Rafale is unique in the sense that it is the only aircraft of its time to be solely built by France, that involved major French defence contractors, such as Dassault and Thales.

                    To counter the latest versions of the Pakistani F-16s, the Indian government wanted their Mig-21 fleet to be replaced by the Rafale jet. Ahead of the Indian Air Force Day on 8 October 2019, a ceremony was conducted for the first formal hand over of the Rafale at the Dassault’s manufacturing facility in Bordeaux. The aircraft had the tail number “RB-001” to mark IAF chief-designate Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria’s role in the 2016 deal.
